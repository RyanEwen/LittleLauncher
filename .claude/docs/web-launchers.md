# Web Launchers

A launcher whose `Kind` is `LauncherKinds.Web` opens `WebFlyoutWindow` instead of `FlyoutWindow`:
a tray-anchored WebView2 on `Launcher.WebUrl`. The motivating case is a Home Assistant dashboard —
camera cards and an agenda, one tray click away, and costing nothing while it is not being looked at.

## Routing — never branch on kind at the call site

`Windows/LauncherPanels.cs` is the only place that decides which window a launcher opens. Tray
clicks, the companion exe's `PostMessage`, launcher deletion and sync-driven removal all go through
`LauncherPanels.Toggle` / `.Dispose` / `.WarmUp`. Add a new entry point there, not another
`FlyoutWindow.Toggle` call.

`LauncherPanels.SyncKind` runs from `MainWindow.RefreshTrayIcons` and destroys the window a
launcher no longer uses — without it, a launcher switched from items to web keeps a warmed-up
flyout (or a loaded browser) it can never show again.

## The resource contract

This is the whole point of the feature, so it is the thing not to regress.

| State | What exists | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Never opened since app start | No window, no browser | Nothing |
| Open | Window + browser, visible | A browser tab's worth |
| Dismissed | Window parked off screen, browser collapsed + suspended, `MemoryUsageTargetLevel = Low` | Minimal — rendering, video and timers stop |
| Dismissed past `WebIdleUnloadMinutes` (default policy) | Window only | Nothing |

- **Collapsing the control is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** WebView2 refuses to suspend a visible
  browser, and the WinUI `WebView2` control drives `CoreWebView2Controller.IsVisible` from its XAML
  `Visibility`. Collapsing is therefore both what stops the rendering and what makes
  `TrySuspendAsync` legal.
- **Suspension is best-effort; the unload is the guarantee.** `TrySuspendAsync` declines in cases
  like active media capture or a download in flight. Treat a `false` return as normal (it is logged
  at debug) — the idle timer is what makes the promise true, because after it fires there is no
  browser process left to consume anything.
- **`WarmUp` deliberately skips web launchers.** The flyout is pre-rendered at startup because its
  content is expensive to re-rasterise; doing that for a browser would boot a renderer for a page
  the user may never open, which is exactly the cost this feature exists to avoid.
- The **window** does outlive a dismissal, parked off the virtual screen like the flyout. An empty
  WinUI window costs nothing, and it keeps the reopen a pure move.

## WinUI WebView2 limits worked around here

- **No controller access.** WinUI's `WebView2` never exposes `CoreWebView2Controller`, so
  `ZoomFactor` — which lives there — is unavailable, unlike in the WPF and WinForms wrappers. Zoom
  is applied as a CSS `zoom` on the document element and **re-applied on every
  `NavigationCompleted`**, because it lives in the document rather than on the control.
- **Escape only works while the XAML tree has focus.** Once the page takes focus the browser owns
  the key, which is why the header keeps a close button. Both the `KeyboardAccelerator` and the
  `WM_KEYDOWN` subclass are best-effort.
- **Focus loss must be verified, not trusted.** The browser's HWNDs are children of the window, so
  clicking into the page raises `Deactivated` without the user having gone anywhere. The handler
  re-checks `GetForegroundWindow()` against the window and `IsChild` on the next dispatcher turn,
  and only then dismisses.
- **The first show of a window's life is not animated.** WinUI has never drawn it, so it would
  present its extended frame — a black rectangle — for the frames XAML takes to paint. The flyout
  hides this by pre-rendering off screen at startup; a web launcher must not, so it takes the plain
  show once and slides on every open after that.

## Manual resize on a borderless window

The flyout has **no non-client area at all**, which means there is no system sizing border to
drag — and `WM_NCHITTEST` never reaches this window for a point over the XAML island or the hosted
browser, so the usual `WS_THICKFRAME` + `WM_NCCALCSIZE` trick has nothing to hit-test either.

Resizing is therefore done in XAML: `AddResizeGrips` overlays four transparent edge strips and four
corner squares (`Grid.RowSpan` across the whole window), each carrying its `ResizeEdges` in `Tag`.
A press captures the pointer and records the cursor and window rects in *screen* coordinates; each
move recomputes the rect from the raw cursor delta and calls `SetWindowPos`. Two details matter:

- **A transparent `Background` is required.** A `null` background is not hit-testable, so the grips
  would be invisible to the pointer as well as to the eye.
- **The content is inset by `GripThickness`**, so the browser never physically occupies the strip
  the grips need. They sit above it in z-order regardless, but a hosted browser is not an ordinary
  XAML sibling, and disjoint rectangles make the edges grabbable no matter how WebView2 routes its
  own input.

The size is persisted **only on pointer release**, never from the placement code: every open clamps
the flyout to the work area, and writing that back would silently shrink the launcher the first
time it opened on a smaller screen.

`_isResizing` pins the flyout open, exactly like `_isModalOpen` — a drag that strays outside the
window must not read as "the user clicked elsewhere".

## Opening launcher settings from the flyout

The header's gear runs `OpenLauncherSettingsAsync`, which follows the item flyout's `RunModalAsync`
contract: pin the flyout (`_isModalOpen`), **drop always-on-top** — owner relationship alone does
not beat a topmost owner, so the settings window would open behind the flyout that spawned it —
then restore both, re-apply the launcher's settings, and hand activation back so the flyout can
dismiss itself again.

Everything after the `await` must tolerate the window being gone: switching `Kind` to Shortcuts in
that window disposes this very flyout.

## The header

Back (left, where a browser puts it — it acts on the page, not the flyout) and, on the right,
pin / launcher settings / reload / open in browser / close. Back is driven by `HistoryChanged`
rather than `NavigationCompleted`: a dashboard is usually a single-page app, so most of its
navigation is history pushed by script with no document load to hang the update off.

**Passkeys work** — verified against a real sign-in. WebAuthn with a Windows Hello platform
authenticator completes inside the flyout; credentials belong to the OS, so the per-launcher user
data folder does not isolate them.

## Discoverability

Two mechanisms, doing different jobs:

- **`+ Add Web Launcher` on the Launchers page** — permanent, and the one that matters long term.
  The kind is otherwise only discoverable by creating an ordinary launcher and noticing the Type
  dropdown, which nobody does unprompted. It creates the launcher and opens its settings with the
  caret already in the address field, which is the only thing left to supply.
- **A one-time Home page notice for upgraders** (`UserSettings.ShowWebLauncherNotice`, raised by
  `SettingsManager.RaiseUpgradeNotices`). Store updates install silently, so this is the only
  channel that reaches those users; a Windows toast would not, because `AppNotificationManager`
  is registered for unpackaged builds only.

## Settings layout

Launcher settings show only **Web Address** and **Flyout Size** for a web launcher. Zoom, When
Hidden, Unload After, Reload On Open, Pin Open and Browsing Data live in a collapsed **Advanced**
expander: they tune a launcher that already works, and putting all eight fields on one surface made
the common case (paste a URL, pick a size) read as a form to fill in. Pin is safe to demote twice
over — the flyout's own header has a pin button.

New per-launcher web settings should default to Advanced unless a launcher is unusable without
them.

**The window does not resize when Advanced expands.** Growing it to fit was tried and rejected:
the window sizes to its form once on `Loaded`, so re-sizing afterwards lands a beat *after* the
expander has already animated and reads as a jolt. The form already lives in a `ScrollViewer`
with the button row pinned below it, so expanding simply scrolls.

**The page's own icon is the default tray icon.** `CoreWebView2.FaviconChanged` gives whatever the
page declares, which is the only source that works for a dashboard behind a login —
`FaviconService` fetches over plain HTTP with no session and gets a redirect instead of an icon.
Both that provisional fetch and the page icon write the same managed path
(`web-favicon-{launcherId}.png`), which is what lets `MayAdoptPageIcon` tell an icon *we* adopted
from one the user chose: the former is upgraded freely, the latter is never touched.

**The address can be chosen from browser bookmarks.** `Pages/BookmarkPicker.PickAsync` shows a
searchable, flattened list of the bookmarks in a chosen browser profile — a dashboard URL is
miserable to type from memory and is invariably already bookmarked. It shares its reading half
with the multi-select import flow (`BookmarkImport.ReadBookmarks` / `.Flatten`,
`BrowserCatalog`) but not its presentation: that flow is a tree you browse to tick a set, this one
answers "which single page?" for a user who already knows and just needs to find it. Search is
term-wise across name, URL *and* folder path, because titles and URLs rarely order the words the
way the user remembers them.

## Profiles

Each web launcher gets `%AppData%\LittleLauncher\WebProfiles\{launcherId}` as its WebView2 user-data
folder (via `MainWindow.GetPhysicalAppDataDir()`, so it survives MSIX VFS redirection). That is what
keeps a dashboard signed in across restarts, and keeps two launchers signed in as different users.
"Clear browsing data" in launcher settings calls `CoreWebView2.Profile.ClearBrowsingDataAsync()`
when the flyout is loaded, and deletes the folder when it is not.

## Settings that must default to zero / false

`settings.json` is written with `DefaultIgnoreCondition = WhenWritingDefault`, so a property holding
the CLR default is **omitted from the file**. Two consequences shape these properties:

- Numeric settings (`WebFlyoutWidth`, `WebFlyoutHeight`, `WebZoomPercent`, `WebIdleUnloadMinutes`)
  store `0` for "unset" and resolve their real defaults through the `Resolved*` properties on
  `Launcher`. Do not put the default in the field initialiser.
- Booleans must be phrased so `false` is the default behaviour — hence `WebPinFlyout` rather than an
  auto-hide flag. A bool defaulting to `true` **cannot be turned off**: `false` is dropped on write
  and the initialiser puts it back on load.
- `WebHiddenPolicies.UnloadWhenIdle` is `0` for the same reason: the cheapest behaviour is the one
  that survives being omitted.

## Vocabulary

The window is a *flyout*, not a *panel* — matching `FlyoutWindow`, the `Flyout*` settings, and the
sibling Persistent app it takes its conventions from (`AppFlyout`, `FlyoutWidth`/`FlyoutHeight`,
`PinFlyout`, `SuspendWebViewAsync`). Keep new names in that family.
